# Project Edutainment
 A Mission in Gamifying Education

Project Edutainment is an educational web-based game built using HTML5 that is aimed towards children. The player receives a score by successfully completing multiple “micro games” which are short, unique games delivered in quick succession that are designed to reinforce simple concepts that the player learns in primary/elementary school. This game is designed to facilitate learning by encouraging the player to replay these micro game that test the player’s skill and/or knowledge in education-based concepts in order to receive a higher score.
