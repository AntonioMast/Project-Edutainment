# Project Edutainment
 A Mission in Gamifying Education

Project Edutainment is an educational web-based game built using HTML5 that is aimed towards children. The player receives a score by successfully completing multiple “micro games” which are short, unique games delivered in quick succession that are designed to reinforce simple concepts that the player learns in primary/elementary school. This game is designed to facilitate learning by encouraging the player to replay these micro game that test the player’s skill and/or knowledge in education-based concepts in order to receive a higher score.

Play the game on my itch.io page here: https://amastroi.itch.io/project-edutainment

Please note that all art and sound assets are NOT distrubted here due to liscense agreements. You will have to supply your own art and sound assets if you wish to try the project from this download.

If you would like to run this project on a local machine, you will need a web server to play. I recommend the Mongoose Embedded Web Server. You can find it here https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose
Additionally, don't forget to place your art and sound assets in the assets folder, otherwise the art and sound will be broken.
